# == Overview ==
#
# This is an example YAML configuration file for Bohr.
#
# Uncommented sections correspond to Bohr defaults so can be loaded
# without modification.
#
# Commented sections can be uncommented and modified to suit your
# needs.


#
# == Observers ==
#

# Bohr ships with several bundled observers, all of which will be
# loaded by default unless you uncomment the following section and
# specify subsections.
# 
# bundled-observers:
#   - 'system/*.clj'
#   - 'elasticsearch/*.clj'

#
# == External Scripts ==
#

# External scripts, whether defining observers or journals or anything
# else, can be loaded below:
#
# load:
#   - /var/lib/bohr/*.clj


#
# == Journals ==
#

# Bohr ships with several bundled journals.  None of these journals
# will be used by default unless declared here (though Bohr will
# default to the 'console' journal at runtime if it can't find any
# others).
# 
# bundled-journals:
#   - console
#   - riemann


#
# == Riemann Journal ==
#

# Configuration values for the 'riemann' key are passed directly to
# the official Riemann Clojure client.
#
# See https://github.com/riemann/riemann-clojure-client for details.
# Default value is below
riemann:
    host: localhost

#
# == Expected Processes ==
#
# ps.expected:
#   - name: my_app
#     user: my_app_user
#     cmd:  my_appd

#
# == File Checksums ==
#
# checksum.files:
#   - path: /etc/passwd
#   - path: /etc/group

#
# == Directories Tracked ==
#
# dirs.tracked:
#   - path: /etc/passwd
#   - path: /etc/group
